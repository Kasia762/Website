Python library used:
sqlite3
pandas
keyboard
tabulate
Make sure to have the modules installed
Run python file -- products.py to manipulate the data of the products
You can import data from productsTest3.csv, it does support so far just this type of document
!!didnt manage to make succesful connection between SQL js and html
The data view in products tab is hardcoded in js file -- products.js
There are therefore two parts:
--visual part
--data storage part
----VISUAL PART----
Run body.html file
---DATA STORAGE PART---
Run python file products.py
There is no GUI made in such short time
Follow instructions in terminal:
The program will create the database in not made
1. Type Import in terminal when aske what to do with data
2. Type file name productsTest3.csv
3. Type True if the name is corrrect
Your data from csv file uploaded to the database

----What i would change/improve/didnt manage---
i would add GUI for data maniputation to make it easier for the user to imput data
i woudl set up connection between data base and html products view
i havent manage to make cart part of assignment, which i believe is stricklty connected with SQL connection(i would create SQL file for cart products storege)
